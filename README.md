StringUtils
===========

This is my “String Utilities” library for _Scala 2_, which includes my `Q`
interpolator. Please see the source code and tests for more information.

If you are looking for the StringUtils library that is included in the
Second Edition of the Scala Cookbook, see my
[Scala3StringUtils](https://github.com/alvinj/Scala3StringUtils)
repository. All of that code has been updated for _Scala 3_, including
the `Q` interpolator, which uses the Scala 3 `given` and `using` constructs.
